# Basic-Port-Scan
Basic Portscan Tool

This is a basic tool that will check ports number to see if they respond to a connection

This is not a particularly good compared to NMAP or ZENMAP but does not need to be installed and can be run on a PC to check connectivity

You can scan a single port, range or ports or ports from a text file

I wrote this when I wanted to test some basic connectivity between a site and remote servers
